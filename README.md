Drop and swap!

Written by Kieran McDonald

Drop and Swap was born out of love for Panel De Pon 
and Puyo Puyo. It started out as a joke, but it turned 
into a fun and challenging project. I'd always wanted to 
make a video game since I started playing and hacking 
them on the Commodore 64. I'm glad I finally got the
chance. 

Hope you enjoy it :)
